# Add-on Notes

The add-on supports adding its own notes. These are entirely separated from your
Anki collection and saved in the add-on's database.

Notes can currently be used for writing texts in markdown, reading PDF files and
watching YouTube videos.

## Creating new notes
From the Anki menubar, select `SIAC>Import>New`. It is also possible to define a
keyboard shortcut for this option in the [settings](text/docs/settings#shortcuts).
