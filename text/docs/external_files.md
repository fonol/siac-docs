# External files

SIAC allows you to link files on your hard-drive with SIAC notes. This can be very useful if you want to use the add-on's priority and scheduling system as a cue to work on tasks, projects, or media not supported by SIAC. For instance, you could link a SIAC note to an Excel file to do your taxes, a homework assignment written in a Word document, or the recording of a lecture you still have to watch.

## Linking to an external file
[Create a new SIAC note](addon_notes.md#Creating_new_notes) in the add-on. Now, click on external file. A new dialog will appear.
